# Complex-Network-_-Structural-descriptors-of-complex-networks
How do we manage to use Structural descriptors of complex networks

Through this project, I am presenting the individual work I did. Working on the first activity was a real
challenge and a very exciting exercise indeed. First, we had to work on all the networks, then focused
on the airport one. In the end, we had to plot the different networks and compare their representations
to select the best.


To start with, the software used in my work is Google Colab. Following the use of Google Colab, I
used the package NetworkX. The programming language used is Python. The choice of the software
and the language can be explained by the fact that I am very confident when it comes to Python and
I have used Google Colab a lot so it helped me code better and use the NetworkX Package in a very
easy and optimized way.
I also tried working with iGraph but I preferred at the end working with NetworkX.
